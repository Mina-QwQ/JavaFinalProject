This game is called BUNNIES 15 20! 🐰 🥕 This is a simple client-server multiplayer game adapted from a modern Chinese drinking game called "15-20". 
HOW TO PLAY: 
1.  Wait for both clients to join the server. The start button will not be clickable until two players join the game. 
2.  Once both clients have joined, the dots will stop blinking; the start button will be clickable. Once both clients click, the game will begin.
3.  There is a ten second timer on the top. You have two tasks. The first task is to select 0 bunnies 🐰, 1 bunny 🐰, or 2 bunnies 🐰 on your window by clicking on the bunny 🐰 images. This may be a random choice, but do not let your opponent see! You will know a bunny 🐰  is selected when its borders turn green. The second task is to input a number on the bottom of the window. This will be your guess of how many bunnies you AND your opponent chose in total. 
4.  Once the timer is up, a new window will display your results. If only you or your opponent guessed correctly, the game will end. If neither or both of you guessed correctly, you will need to play again. The bunny 🐰 image on the top displays how many bunnies YOU chose, and the bunny 🐰 image on the bottom displays how many bunnies your OPPONENT chose. 

This game requires the use of thread concurrency, networking, and the Java Graphics and Swing libraries. 
To run the game, download the entire folder. Run the server source code. Then, run the client code on the same or different machines on the same network.

Enjoy the game!!!🐇🐇🐇🐇
